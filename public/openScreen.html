        >Hello Scholar,<br />The head of planetary exploration team has recently
        found a very unique anomaly, something we have never seen before.<br />The
        planet seems mystical in a way, no matter how hard we try, our
        inexperienced eyes cannot see through the magical acts of the vegetation
        living within.<br />Using the magical mana substance we have created
        various tools at your disposal, they seem to be able to interact with
        plants.<br />We hope that you will visit this planet and uncover the
        mysteries hidden by the foggy skies.<br />Thank you for your patronage.
